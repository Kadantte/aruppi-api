Aruppi API has been developed to bring together all the information about Japanese culture, from anime and manga to the most secret places in Japan, its gastronomy and even its festivities.

We are in continuous development to implement more features and improvements in the functioning of it, to later implement it in the mobile application.

## **:wrench: Developer usage**

### **Set up project**

Before cloning the repo **be sure** you have installed:

- [**NODE**](https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+install+node) (version >= 12.17.x)

In your package manager you can use either **yarn** or **npm**,
you need to have installed these versions:

- [**NPM**](https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+install+npm) (version >= 6.14.x)
- [**YARN**](https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+install+yarn) (version >= 1.22.x)

Then:

- Choose a folder project in your system and switch in `cd [folder path]`
- Clone the repo in your folder path `git clone https://github.com/aruppi/aruppi-api`.

Here are the steps to get started with the project on both platforms, use the corresponding commands if **npm** or **yarn**.

## 📖 API Documentation

**Documentation coming soon** at the following link: [**Aruppi Wiki**](https://github.com/aruppi/aruppi-api/wiki)
Where we will show more information about the calls and queries together with the response obtained or the different types of variables in some of the queries.

## Countdown to deprecation of v3 API

Aruppi API version 3.x.x has been deprecated, that's why all of you who are using it should migrate as soon as possible to version 4.x.x which we have already released.

Otherwise, if you want to use older versions you can host them yourself on your servers, and download the code in the corresponding branches of [**v2.x.x**](https://github.com/aruppi/aruppi-api/tree/v2) and [**v3.x.x**](https://github.com/aruppi/aruppi-api/tree/v3). In case you want to use an even lower version of the API we recommend you to have a look at this other version [**v1.x.x**](https://github.com/aruppi/aruppi-api-v1)

Currently the Aruppi app on Android is already using the v4.x.x API services from version v2.0.8, which you can download from our website: [**Download Aruppi App**](https://aruppi.jeluchu.com/download)
